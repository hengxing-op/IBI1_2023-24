Based on the feedback received, I made the following corrections to my Week 6 tasks:

"Average day" Task:

Issue: I forgot to set and print a variable for the activity that can be modified to return the correct number of hours spent on that activity.

Correction: Added the following code to set and print the requested activity:
```python
requested_activity = 'TV'
print(f"Hours spent on {requested_activity}: {activities[requested_activity]}")
```


"City sizes" Task:

Issue: I missed printing two sorted lists of city sizes.

Correction: Added the following code to print the sorted lists:
```python
print("Sorted UK city populations:", sorted_uk_cities)
print("Sorted China city populations:", sorted_china_cities)
```


### Future Improvements

To avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will carefully review the task guidelines to ensure all requirements are met and all code is thoroughly checked before submission.
