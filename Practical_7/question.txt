Discussion:
The result was expected. These countries (Iceland, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland) are known for their advanced healthcare systems and high living standards.
The reasons may be these countries have better healthcare, economic stability, effective public health policies, healthier lifestyles, and advanced medical technologies, leading to lower DALYs.
Summary:
Countries with strong healthcare systems and high living standards tend to have lower DALYs, indicating a lower burden of disease.
